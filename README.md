# Take Note

## Description

This repository was created so I could create the back-end JavaScript for a website that allows users to write, save, read, and delete notes.

You can use the commits to follow my journey.



### How did I do it?

I used JavaScript and the following Node.js packages: the built in "fs" and "path" packages, and an installed via npm package called "express" to write my back-end server code. 

If you wish to visit this website you can do so via this link: https://safe-meadow-07828.herokuapp.com/ .



### Installation

If you wish to fork this code for your own use, then make sure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/). And after you've cloned or downloaded the repository use the command "npm install" in the terminal to install the necessary "express" package (make sure your terminal is in the same directory as the package.json file). If you have everything installed, you simply have to have your terminal in the same direcetory as server.js and use the command "node server.js" to run it. Once it runs you will need to type "localhost:3000" in the address bar of your browser to access the html files the server is supporting.



### Usage

To use this note taker click on the link in the "How did I do it?" section of this README.md, once the website loads click the "Get Started" button which will take you to the notes page. Once on the notes page use the the provided text areas to write your notes, the save button to save them, the delete button to delete them, the new note button to start a new note, and click on the desired saved note to read it. 



### Credits

I used Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/), the "express" package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).

The HTML files and notes.html's CSS and JavaScript were provided by Trilogy Education Services (https://www.trilogyed.com/).

Some of the styling was thanks to the power of Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/).

The provided JavaScript utilizes the jQuery library (https://api.jquery.com/).
